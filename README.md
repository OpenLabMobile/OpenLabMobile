This is the official OpenLabMobile GitHub account. 
As part of our daily work, we create various projects that we want to share as a commitment to the open source community.
Some of the things you will find here on our GitHub are projects we have created to teach others about technology in workshops.
Some are also showcases to give people an understanding of what is possible with modern manufacturing methods, while others have just been developed to improve our daily work and life with the OpenLabMobile truck.

The OpenLabMobile is an open source hardware project dedicated to teaching others about technology and empowering students and trainees to become the inventors of the future.
In the next phase of our project, we will focus on companies in and around Hamburg, helping them to innovate their prototyping and manufacturing processes with modern manufacturing methods, including teaching staff how to use laser cutters, 3D printers, CAD programs and cnc mills. 
The services we provide to our clients are free of charge.
